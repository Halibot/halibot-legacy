Halibot
-------

Introducing *Halibot!* The worlds most astounding saltwater xmpp bot! Its diet primarily consists
of modules that it finds in the directory termed `modules`, and is highly prized among the xmpp
community for its ease of use, ease of module implementation, and ease of digestion.


Configuration
-------------

Halibot expects in the same directory as it is run, to be a JSON-formatted file called `config.json`.
Below is a list of top-level keys and their significance.
Module config options are documented somewhere else probably.

- `admins` : Array of jid's that should be allowed to run admin commands.
- `jid` : User for the bot to connect with.
- `muc` : Array of JSON objects with a `nick` and `room` keys. (See sample config)

    "admins": [
